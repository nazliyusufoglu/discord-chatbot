# Chatbot RukyChat
This bot has created for integrating the Google Gemini AI to discord. 

By using this bot, you can chat with bot and it also can tell the true weather condition info to you.

It has been creted in such a way that when the '$’ sign is used at the beginning of the message in 

the chat section, the chatbot will be activated and start generating responds.

And also, there is one more command sign which is “! Weather for”. This command provides 

the connection between chatbot and OpenWeatherMap API
